Last lab! Dynamic Array of Strings

P475 #6. Dynamic Array of Strings

One problem with dynamic arrays is that once the array is created using the new operator the 
size cannot be changed.  For example, you might want to add or delete entries from the array 
similar to the behavior of a vector.  This project asks you to create a class called 
DynamicStringArray that includes member functions that allow it to emulate the behavior of a
vector of strings.

The class should have:

		A default constructor that sets the dynamic array to NULL and sets size to 0.
		A function named addEntry that takes a string as input.  The function should create a new 
	dynamic array one element larger than dynamicArray, copy all elements from dynamicArray into 
	the new array, add the new string onto the end of the new array, increment size, delete the 
	old dynamicArray, and then set dynamicArray to the new array.
		A function named deleteEntry that takes a string as input.  The function should search
	dynamicArray for the string.  If not found, return false.  If found, create a new dynamic 
	array one element smaller than dynamicArray.  Copy all elements except the input string 
	into the new array, delete  dynamicArray, decrement size, and return true.
		A function named getEntry that takes an integer as input and returns the string at that index
	in dynamicArray.  Return NULL if the index is out of dynamicArray’s bounds.
		A copy constructor that makes a copy of the input object’s dynamic array.
		Overload the assignment operator so that the dynamic array is properly copied to the target object.
		A destructor that frees up the memory allocated to the dynamic array.

Embed your class in a suitable test program.
