/*
Lab 4 - Contact Database

Write a program that implements a database system. The program will use an array of type contact to store
contact information (maximum size 100). The program should be written using 2 class files. One class will
implement a contact object and the second class will implement the database and include the main method.

The contact class should include instance variables to store the contact's first name, last name, phone
number, and email address. Add appropriate constructors, accessor and mutator methods, an input method,
and overloaded << function. Your database class should include a method to display a menu that allows the
client to add a contact, display all contacts, search for a contact by phone number, and delete a contact.
You may add a method to edit a contact for extra credit. 

Input the existing contact information for 10 contacts into the database's array instance variable from a
file (use an initialize method).
